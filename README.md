# Lukita-ML

## About The Model
  - We create a model which can classify images using Convolutional Neural Network  architecture. After classifying an image, we also provide image description and  similar images using recommendation systems from previously uploaded images. In the final step, we export our model into h5 and TensorFlowLite to deploy model on mobile devices.
  - This version of the model is the local version. This model uses a local database (not including credential keys). This repository also includes the development models that we have built.

## ML team responsibilities : 
 - Collect and prepare a dataset.
 - Building a machine learning model which can classify images using CNN architecture.
 - Create image descriptions and similar image features
